**Not just a mild winter: unveiling France's energy conservation policy** - Marie Bruguet
> *In the context of heightened price volatility and supply constraints, Europe's energy security has been confronted with unprecedented challenges. The influence of energy-saving policies on natural gas demand in France is thus assessed, with particular focus on shifts in household and tertiary sector behavior during the winter 2022 energy crisis.  A structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model is employed , adapted to the specific characteristics of gas markets, and augmented by an index of government interventions in favour of energy conservation. The results demonstrate that conservation policies have had a notable impact on natural gas demand, accounting for an average of 10% of its variation. However, while a price shock results in a sustained decline in demand, a conservation policy leads to a return to equilibrium in demand after approximately twelve months. In terms of natural gas supply, the conservation policy had a series of effects similar to those induced by price shocks, but with greater persistence.
The study demonstrates the effectiveness of policy-based behavioural interventions in moderating energy demand during times of crisis. It also suggests that non-monetary incentives can complement price mechanisms to ensure more sustainable demand reductions. These results have policy implications for enhancing energy security through conservation rather than relying solely on price adjustments.*

**Weather Effects in Energy Seasonal Adjustment: An Application to France Energy Consumption** - Marie Bruguet, Ronan Le Saout, Arthur Thomas (2024)

>*This paper addresses the challenge of accurately adjusting energy consumption data for weather and seasonal variations. In this paper, we revisit the concept of Heating Degree Days (HDD) by proposing a new General Weather Indicator (GWI). This indicator is a vector of the optimal combination of heating and cooling day variables across multiple weather variables, including temperature, wind, sunlight duration, rain, and cloudiness. To construct the GWI, we propose a novel econometric approach which uses K-means to identify thresholds and LASSO penalisation for the selection of variables. An empirical analysis of electricity and natural gas consumption in France reveals that there are nuanced sectoral responses to weather, highlighting the importance of integrating wind and sunlight duration along with temperature. The reliability of the GWI was confirmed by robustness checks across spatial and temporal scales, which demonstrated its suitability for use in different geographical areas and at different data frequencies. Using the traditional base temperature of 17°C instead of the optimal GWI for energy adjustment, we found an underestimated consumption response to temperature of up to 7.3%, or 0.80 TWh per month, equivalent to more than one and a half nuclear reactors, highlighting the importance of accurate weather elasticity estimates.*
