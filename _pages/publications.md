**Weather Effects in Energy Seasonal Adjustment : An Application to France Energy Consumption** (Marie Bruguet, Ronan Le Saoult, Arthur Thomas (2024))\

*Assessing changes in energy consumption to study the impact of energy efficiency and sufficiency policies is challenging as it is influenced by many factors such as socio-economic, political and climatic factors. To make reliable comparisons it is necessary to correct observed consumption for seasonal and weather variations. Building on the standard Unified Degree Days (UDD) indicator that only uses an unjustified temperature threshold, this paper introduces a new robust statistical procedure to construct a General Weather Indicator (GWI) designed for energy
consumption. GWI is defined as the best linear combination of heating days variable (HDV) and cooling days variable (CDV) of various weather variables among temperature, wind, sunlight duration, rain and cloudiness. For each variable, we extract the best(s) threshold(s) that capture the non-linear relationship between the energy consumption and this variable using K-means. Then we select for each energy consumption the best linear combination of these HDV and CDV using a LASSO penalization combined with a standard seasonal adjustment method (regSARIMA).
Applied to France open data energy consumption, the methodology yields a country-specific base temperature and explores alternative meteorological indicators. It also confirms that the base temperature is not static over time or space, emphasizing the need for adaptive parameter adjustments.*
