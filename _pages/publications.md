**Unveiling France’s Energy Conservation Policy : Insights from the 2022-2023 Energy Crisis** - Marie Bruguet
> *In the context of heightened price volatility and supply constraints, Europe's energy security has faced unprecedented challenges. The influence of energy-saving policies on natural gas demand in France is thus assessed, focusing on shifts in household and tertiary sector behaviour during the winter 2022 energy crisis.  A structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model is employed, adapted to the specific characteristics of gas markets, and augmented by an index of government interventions in favour of energy conservation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of policy-based behavioural interventions in moderating energy demand during times of crisis. It also suggests that non-monetary incentives can complement price mechanisms to ensure more sustainable demand reductions. These results have policy implications for enhancing energy security through conservation rather than relying solely on price adjustments.*

**Weather Effects in Energy Seasonal Adjustment: An Application to France Energy Consumption** - Marie Bruguet, Ronan Le Saout, Arthur Thomas (2024) *R&R at The Energy Journal* ; [*Awarded best student paper by the FAEE*](https://www.faee.fr/fr/51-prix-de-l-aee.html)

>*This paper addresses the challenge of adjusting energy consumption data for weather variations by introducing a new General Weather Indicator (GWI). The GWI combines multiple weather variables, including temperature, wind, sunlight, rain, and cloudiness, using a novel econometric approach that applies K-means for threshold identification and LASSO for variable selection. An empirical analysis of electricity and natural gas consumption in France highlights the importance of integrating wind and sunlight, revealing sector-specific responses to weather. Robustness checks across spatial and temporal scales confirm the GWI's reliability. For France, using the traditional base temperature of 18°C, instead of the optimal GWI, leads to an underestimation of energy consumption responses to weather.*
