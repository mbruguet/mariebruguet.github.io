# Ongoing Works
**Not just a mild winter: unveiling France's energy conservation policy** - Marie Bruguet
> *During the winter of 2022/2023, France experienced a notable decrease in energy consumption, potentially driven by a combination of factors, including a milder-than-usual winter, rising energy prices, and
the implementation of a large-scale non-monetary public policy aimed at reducing energy use. These changes occurred during a Europe-wide energy crisis, triggered by a sharp reduction in gas supplies. In  response, public authorities urged both residential and commercial sectors to cut their energy consumption, leading to the introduction of the Plan de Sobriété in France. This research project aims to uncover the sources of these changes in energy consumption behaviour during the winter of 2022/2023, and beyond.*

**Weather Effects in Energy Seasonal Adjustment: An Application to France Energy Consumption** - Marie Bruguet, Ronan Le Saout, Arthur Thomas (2024)

>*This paper addresses the challenge of accurately adjusting energy consumption data for weather and seasonal variations. In this paper, we revisit the concept of Heating Degree Days (HDD) by proposing a new General Weather Indicator (GWI). This indicator is a vector of the optimal combination of heating and cooling day variables across multiple weather variables, including temperature, wind, sunlight duration, rain, and cloudiness. To construct the GWI, we propose a novel econometric approach which uses K-means to identify thresholds and LASSO penalisation for the selection of variables. An empirical analysis of electricity and natural gas consumption in France reveals that there are nuanced sectoral responses to weather, highlighting the importance of integrating wind and sunlight duration along with temperature. The reliability of the GWI was confirmed by robustness checks across spatial and temporal scales, which demonstrated its suitability for use in different geographical areas and at different data frequencies. Using the traditional base temperature of 17°C instead of the optimal GWI for energy adjustment, we found an underestimated consumption response to temperature of up to 7.3%, or 0.80 TWh per month, equivalent to more than one and a half nuclear reactors, highlighting the importance of accurate weather elasticity estimates.*
